# Arduino Uploader
When you need to edit or preview hundreds of thousands of lines or more, the Arduino IDE is obviously not suitable, so I use the VScode editor and install a series of plugins to improve my productivity. The disadvantage of VScode is that the upload process is particularly slow. So I wrote a bat script and some C# code to improve the speed of compilation and upload, and it is easy to use.

## How to use
Just put the sketch folder in the same path as the bat script, which is to replace the folder of your Arduino program with a_sample_sketch.
